## ðŸ“˜ Summary

This project investigates how **sampling frequency** influences the performance and internal coherence of GARCH-based volatility forecasting models in high-frequency foreign exchange (FX) markets.  
Multiple intraday intervals (1-, 5-, 15-, 30-minute, and 1-hour) are evaluated using **rolling-window, walk-forward estimation** frameworks.

The thesis compares several GARCH-family specifications â€” including **GARCH(1,1)**, **EGARCH**, **TGARCH**, and **GJRâ€“GARCH** with **Student-t innovations** â€” across multiple datasets to assess forecasting accuracy, multi-step variance aggregation, and cross-frequency consistency.

Forecast accuracy is measured using **MSE**, **RMSE**, **MAE**, **Coverage**, **QLIKE**, and **Quasi-Deviance**, with robustness checks via **Dieboldâ€“Mariano (DM)** tests.  

Additionally, higher-frequency forecasts are **aggregated to approximate lower-frequency realised variances**, providing insight into how fine-scale information transfers across time horizons.

A **triangular exchange-rate diagnostic** (GBPEURâ€“USDEURâ€“USDGBP) is used to test internal coherence under the no-arbitrage assumption via **MARE** and **correlation-gap metrics**.
